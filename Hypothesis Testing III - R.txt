#Robinson et al. (A-29) studied nine subjects who underwent baffle procedure for transposition of the
#great arteries (TGA). At baseline, the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (measured in WU  m2)
#values at rest yielded a standard deviation of 28. Can we conclude from these data that the SVR
#variance of a population of similar subjects with TGA is not 700? Let alpha equal .10.

	#between 2.733 and 15.507, do not reject the null

#Vital capacity values were recorded for a sample of 10 patients with severe chronic airway
#obstruction. The variance of the 10 observations was .75. Test the null hypothesis that the population
#variance is 1.00. Let alpha equal .05

#Subjects in a study by Dabonneville et al. (A-9) included a sample of 40 men who claimed to engage
#in a variety of sports activities (multisport). The mean body mass index (BMI) for these men
#was 22.41 with a standard deviation of 1.27. A sample of 24 male rugby players had a mean BMI of
#27.75 with a standard deviation of 2.64. Is there sufficient evidence for one to claim that, in general,
#rugby players have a higher BMI than the multisport men? Let alpha equal .01.

	# t = (x1-x2) / sp* ssqrt((1/n1) + (1/n2))
	# sp = sqrt(((n1-1)*s1^2 + (n2-1)*s2^2)/(n1+n2-2))

	#since -10.9 is greater than -2.657, the p value is less than .01, reject the null

#Cortisol level determinations were made on two samples of women at childbirth. Group 1 subjects
#underwent emergency cesarean section following induced labor. Group 2 subjects delivered by either
#cesarean section or the vaginal route following spontaneous labor. The sample sizes, mean cortisol
#levels, and standard deviations were as follows:

#Sample n   x   s
#1 	10 435 65
#2 	12 645 80

#Do these data provide sufficient evidence to indicate a difference in the mean cortisol levels in the
#populations represented? Let alpha equal .05.

	# t = (x1-x2) / sp* ssqrt((1/n1) + (1/n2))
	# sp = sqrt(((n1-1)*s1^2 + (n2-1)*s2^2)/(n1+n2-2))

	qt(.975, 20) #2.08

	#since -6.66 is greater than 2.08, the p value is less than .005, reject the null

#Ellen Davis Jones (A-15) studied the effects of reminiscence therapy for older women with
#depression. She studied 15 women 60 years or older residing for 3 months or longer in an assisted
#living long-term care facility. For this study, depression was measured by the Geriatric Depression
#Scale (GDS). Higher scores indicate more severe depression symptoms. The participants received
#reminiscence therapy for long-term care, which uses family photographs, scrapbooks, and personal
#memorabilia to stimulate memory and conversation among group members. Pre-treatment and posttreatment
#depression scores are given in the following table. Can we conclude, based on these data,
#that subjects who participate in reminiscence therapy experience, on average, a decline in GDS
#depression scores? Let alpha equal .01.
