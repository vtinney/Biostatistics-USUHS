#Hypothesis Testing IV - R

#7.5.2

#In an article in the journal Health and Place, Hui and Bell (A-22) found that among 2428 boys ages
#7 to 12 years, 461 were overweight or obese. On the basis of this study, can we conclude that more
#than 15 percent of the boys ages 7 to 12 in the sampled population are obese or overweight? Let
#alpha = .05.

(.1899-.15)/(sqrt((.15*.85)/2428))

#greater than 1.645, reject the null

#7.6.2

#Landolt et al. (A-26) examined rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in mothers and fathers.
#Parents were interviewed 5 to 6 weeks after an accident or a new diagnosis of cancer or diabetes
#mellitus type I for their child. Twenty-eight of the 175 fathers interviewed and 43 of the 180 mothers
#interviewed met the criteria for current PTSD. Is there sufficient evidence for us to conclude that
#fathers are less likely to develop PTSD than mothers when a child is traumatized by an accident,
#cancer diagnosis, or diabetes diagnosis? Let alpha = .05.

(-.0789)/sqrt((.2*.8)/175+(.2*.8)/180)

#less than -1.645, reject the null

#7.8.4
#In an experiment to assess the effects on rats of exposure to cigarette smoke, 11 animals were
#exposed and 11 control animals were not exposed to smoke from unfiltered cigarettes. At the end
#of the experiment, measurements were made of the frequency of the ciliary beat (beats/min at
#20C) in each animal. The variance for the exposed group was 3400 and 1200 for the unexposed
#group. Do these data indicate that in the populations represented the variances are different?
#Let alpha = .05.

qf(.975, df1=10, df2=10) #3.72
qf(.025, df1=10, df2=10) #0.269

3400/1200 #2.83

#2.83 is between 3.72 and .269 so we do not reject the null
