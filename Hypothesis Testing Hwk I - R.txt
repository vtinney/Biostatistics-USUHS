#Hypothesis Testing I

#7.2.1

#Escobar et al. (A-3) performed a study to validate a translated version of the Western Ontario and
#McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire used with Spanish-speaking
#patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis. For the 76 women classified with severe hip pain, the
#WOMAC mean function score (on a scale from 0 to 100 with a higher number indicating less
#function) was 70.7 with a standard deviation of 14.6. We wish to know if we may conclude that the
#mean function score for a population of similar women subjects with severe hip pain is less than 75.
#Let alpha :01.

# z = Xbar-mean / s*sqrt(n)

	(70.7-75)/(14.6/sqrt(76))

	#-2.57, less than or equal to -2.33 (alpha 0.1), therefore reject the null


#7.2.2

#A study by Thienprasiddhi et al. (A-4) examined a sample of 16 subjects with open-angle glaucoma
#and unilateral hemifield defects. The ages (years) of the subjects were:

	ages <- c(62, 62, 68, 48, 51, 60, 51, 57, 57, 41, 62, 50, 53, 34, 62, 61)
	mean(ages)
	sd(ages)

	(54.9375-60)/(8.8729/sqrt(16)) #-2.28
	#alpha 0.5 = -1.7530, so we reject the null


#Can we conclude that the mean age of the population from which the sample may be presumed to
#have been drawn is less than 60 years? Let alpha :05

#7.2.6

#Nine laboratory animals were infected with a certain bacterium and then immunosuppressed. The
#mean number of organisms later recovered from tissue specimens was 6.5 (coded data) with a
#standard deviation of .6. Can one conclude from these data that the population mean is greater than 6?
#Let alpha:05. What assumptions are necessary?

	(6.5-6)/(0.6/sqrt(9)) #2.5
	#alpha 1.8595, so we reject the null

#7.2.9	

#A survey of 100 similar-sized hospitals revealed a mean daily census in the pediatrics service of 27
#with a standard deviation of 6.5. Do these data provide sufficient evidence to indicate that the
#population mean is greater than 25? Let alpha:05

	(27-25)/(6.5/sqrt(100)) #3.08
	#3.08 greater than 1.645, reject the null
