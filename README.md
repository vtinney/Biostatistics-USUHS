# Biostatistics-USUHS
Biostatistics I class at USUHS

Here you can find all of the problems for the homework Biostatistics I taught at the Uniformed Services University for the Health Sciences by Dr. David Cruess. I will be adding them as the course goes on, and they will be available in R and STATA.

Thanks!
Veronica


Helpful notes

## is not part of the code. # is a symbol used to explain or make notes to the code. If you copy paste the # symbol to STATA, you will get an error message, but will get no error message in R.
