# Biostatistics-USUHS
Biostatistics I class at USUHS

Here you can find all of the problems for the homework Biostatistics I taught at the Uniformed Services University for the Health Sciences by Dr. David Cruess. I will be adding them as the course goes on, and they will be available in R and STATA. Unless otherwise noted, all questions are from the textbook: Biostatistics: a foundation for analysis in the health sciences by Daniel, Wayne W; Cross, Chad Lee 2013, Tenth edition.

Thanks!

Helpful notes

The (##) symbol is not part of the code. # is a symbol used to explain or make notes to the code. If you copy paste the (#) symbol to STATA, you will get an error message, but will get no error message in R.
